"# AGROZON-py"

 AGROZON is a console-based e-commerce platform developed using Python, aimed at 
revolutionizing the way agricultural products are distributed and accessed in rural and semi-urban 
regions. In a country like India, where agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and livelihood of 
millions, digital solutions tailored for farmers and local sellers are essential. AGROZON addresses 
this need by providing a lightweight, command-line interface that enables users to register, log in, 
browse a diverse catalog of groceries and farm produce, manage a shopping cart, and place orders—
all without the need for graphical environments or high-end devices.
